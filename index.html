# Welcome to Age Buddies!

------

Are you an Age of Empires II player who loves the game and wants to connect with a fun, supportive community? You've found your home! We're an online cohort of AoE2 enthusiasts, united by our passion for the game and our desire to have a great time together.

## Who We Are

We're a group of dedicated Age of Empires II players with an **Elo rating typically between 700 and 1100**. Some people would call us LEL (Low Elo Players) but that doesnÂ´t bother us. We are here to have fun playing this game together with this great community. We are helping each other to climb higher in the ranked latter and we play Team Games very often.

## What We Do

Our group is all about having fun and growing together. Here's what you can expect:

- **Team Games:** We frequently organize and play team games over voice, bringing strategy and cooperation to the forefront.
- **1v1 Practice:** Looking to sharpen your individual skills? We regularly practice 1v1 matches, offering a supportive environment for improvement.
- **Community Games:** Beyond ranked play, we enjoy various community games, fostering camaraderie and diverse gameplay experiences.
- **Climbing the Ladder:** We actively help each other climb higher in the ranked ladder, sharing tips, strategies, and encouragement.
